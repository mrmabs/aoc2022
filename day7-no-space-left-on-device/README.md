# Day 7 - No Space Left On Device

## In *drum roll* php[7]!

I'm late on this one because I started in GNU Smalltalk. Can I just say, when a variable changes its value because of your formatting, you might have a problem. I keep doing work arounds, and eventually had to give up.

Yes, I know I could have used linked lists and all kinds of fancy techniques, getting all the file sizes and building sizes for the sub directories and putting together a complete picture. But I deliberately mdid not do tht this time, choosing to see if I could solve it in a different way. This code could actually be ported to other languages pretty easily, like BASIC, so it's faily generic. I probably could have made a fancy web page to show the result for this one, but after the debacle with GNU Smalltalk, I dropped that plan.

## Personal history

I messed with php for a little while to build dynamic pages way back around php3. Not long after I started playing with Python and I never really made use of php again.

## Running

Today's solution was much simpler and both answers come from the one script.

$ `php day7.php < day7-input.txt`
