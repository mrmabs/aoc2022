# Day 8 Treetop Tree House

## Today in R!

Life getting in the way of getting this one up on time, but I got it done. R is actually not to bad, but I can see why a lot of people have moved to Python.

The quality documentation out there for R is actully really good.


## Running

I have a feeling there is a better way to run this, but it seems to work fine as long as you install the right applications.

$ `r day8pt1.r < day8-input.txt`

$ `r day8pt2.r < day8-input.txt`
