# Day 13: Distress Signal

## Sorting arrays in Javascript (Node JS)

As soon as I saw that the arrays were json format, I really wante to use one of my other programming languagaes on my list, bu function nesting sort of killed that idea.

This one has a lot of if statements to decide bigger or smaller, but I managed to make it work. Definitly could have been simpler with just yes or no decisions.

## Personal history

I have used js on and off for a few years, everthing from animating web pages, to identifying the prowser nd working around quirks, to having web server scripts dynamically generate code for the client browser.

I have brifly used Node JS style coding with the Node MCU, but I recently changed the firmware on that controller to MicroPython.
