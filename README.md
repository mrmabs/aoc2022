# Advent Of Code 2022

My attempts at solving the daily AOC puzzles in 2022, each day in a different programming language.

The strategy here is to knock over the languages that are harder first, and come back to the ones I have used extensively toward the end of Advent.

Ranking in personal difficulty, due to learning curve, language complexity or bugginess; hardest at the top:

## Day 10 - GNU SmallTalk

## Day 03 - [g]awk

## Day 05 - Perl

## Day 07 - Php

## Day 09 - FreePascal

## Day 04 - Haskell

## Day 06 - x86-64 Assembly

## Day 08 - R

## Day 02 - SQLite

## Day 01 - Bash
