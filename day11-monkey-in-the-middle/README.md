# Day 11: Monkey in the Middle

## Finally go there in Ruby

I started today in C++, but I got slowed down by needing to process complex text lines, so I moved to Ruby. Ruby has to be easy, yeah?

Wow, was I wrong, after that, it seems like Ruby has more in common wit Perl than Python. To get past the problem of having numbers overflow, I used a trick with modulus to keep the stress getting out of control. I probably could have found a lower number to make the script run faster.

Part of the Issue I had with Ruby was the documentation, it led me down a few paths that were not the best way to solve the problem.

## Personal history

Ruby was something I played with not long after it came out, everyone talking about how it was an alternative to Python. After a few tutorials, I saw how it could be used for making one liners. It's not until I got right into it that I came across a few of its quirks, some not as predictable as others.
