# Day 10 - Cathode-Ray Tube

## Success in GNU SmallTalk!

I got stuck on Smalltalk on Day 7, but I brought it back on for this one with a win! I only had a few peculiar things happen, this time in relation to reading lines from the text file, hence why I crash out of the loop rather than detect a `nil` to gracefully exit the `while` loop.

As with many of my other uploads, I have left in my "debugging" statements as comments, party to demonstrate this very simple debugging method in my code.

## Personal history

Smalltalk was somrthing I briefly played with in the late 90's, in Squeak. I decided not to get the virtual environment working this time, and elected to use the GNU interpreter.
