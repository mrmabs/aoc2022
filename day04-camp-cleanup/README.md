# Day 4 - Haskell

## My first real challenge, Haskell

This one ended up growing into one liners because of the Functional programming aspects of Haskell, I did consider using functions to improve functionality, but using them did not simplify the code itself.

## Personal history

Before this, I had only done a few tutorials, and mainly only did it to learn Functional programming to improve my coding practice in other languages. I was quite surprised how well I adapted to this language and the learning curve was not that steep.
