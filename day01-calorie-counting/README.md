# Day 1 - Bash

## Starting off in ... Bash!

I've started off this year's challenge in Bash, and this one was relatively straight forward for me.

## Personal history

I've done all kinds of strange scripts in Bash for quite a while, since not long after first playing with Linux back in the mid 90's. It's probably the language I have used most.

## Running

$ `bash day1.sh`
