## Ugh, Perl...

I've never been a big fan of Perl, so don't read anything into how bad these are. This one was frustrating, and I'm glad I got it out of the way this early in. This code will likely break if you look at it the wrong way.

I chose Perl here for text processing capabilities, although I didn't really make use of them with only one regex in all the code. Perl also has push and pop functions, and as it seems, useful unshift (and shift) functions to move data around arrays.

## Personal history

I first tried Perl in about 1997, and got stuck many times on exceptions to the rule, or at least that's how it felt to me. I know a lot of people love it, and there are reasons for the design decisions made, but I never really made use of it in a big way in my own coding practice.
