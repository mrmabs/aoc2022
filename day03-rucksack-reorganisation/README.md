# Day 3 - [g]awk

## This one was a bit, awk-ward

On my list I had sed/awk; s I decided to have a deeper look into writing scripts for either of them, and when I saw what awk was capable of, it was a clear winner.

It was that easy I was concerned I should have picked someting more challenging at this end of Advent. 

## Personal history

Gawk was someting I have touched on using a few times for basic processing of strings in Bash scripts, so I had a bit to learn, extending that out to a full on script. It's even capable of functions!

## Running

$ `cat day3-input.txt | gawk -f day3pt1.awk`

$ `cat day3-input.txt | gawk -f day3pt2.awk`
